# Hicformer: A transformer-based model to predict gene expression

This folder contains the code for the Hicformer model, which is a deep learning model to predict cell type-specific gene expression by integrating DNA sequence and 3D genome structure. Each input consists of a 409,600 bp genomic region and a corresponding Hi-C contact map at 1,024-bp resolution. The model was trained and evaluated using pseudo-bulk data aggregated at the cell type level.
